# Pipe
- [ ] **LAB ONLY** User Warning when executing Block 3. Look into that maybe.
- [x] Just changing the Diameter of one of the Ends shows a Delta H line.
- [x] U1 Text is in the Circle, when Diameter is big.
- [x] Add Units to Calculation output.
- [x] **VOILÀ ONLY** Latex Output is not formatted. Definitely fix that
- [ ] (Nice-To-Have) 3D representation

# Tank
- [ ] **LAB ONLY** User Warning, same as Pipe. Probably pythreejs' fault
- [ ] Maybe add arrow ends to h line.
- [x] Maybe add some kind of animation, when water falls or rises
- [ ] (Nice-To-Have) 3D

# Angle
- [ ] Animation is just not it. Fix it.
- [ ] Animation Loop blocks input feed. Cringe.
- [ ] Add L lines to graphics view, maybe.
- [ ] Make Calculations output more pleasing for the eye, see Pipe's output for reference
- [x] **VOILÀ ONLY** Latex Output is not formatted
